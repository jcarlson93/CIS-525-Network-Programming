Question 1:
After running make then type ./directory to start the directory server.
Next to start a server please type ./server followed by the specified port number and topic.
When the server starts it will connect to the directory and provide a port number and topic.
The following topics with an SSL certificate are: cows, cats, and dogs.	
Directory server takes in two types of inputs from the user: the name of a topic or the character L which lists all the servers currently connected to the directory.

A client connects to the directory server and wants to view all chat servers.

Input	Output
l		Here are all known servers:
		cats
		cows

Input	Output
cats	Server found at port 49523

If a user puts in a server that does not exist, they will be told the server is not found.
Client creates a new username on the cows chat server:

Input	Output
Nick	The certificate for the server is shown
		You are the first users in the chat.
		Enter message (Up to 254 characters)

If a user inputs a message that is beyond 254 characters the message is cut to only the first 254 characters.
If two or more users connect to the same chat server, they are able to communicate with each other.
